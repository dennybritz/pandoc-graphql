Turns your blog posts into a GraphQL API.

## Why would you ever want to do that?

- Cleanly separate your posts from the frontend. Your posts can live in a content-only Github repository and be served to multiple websites or a static site generator.
- Write content in any format, including Markdown or Jupyter, and transform it to multiple output formats like HTML, PDF and RSS
- Use convenient transformations, like adding citations or table of contents, without writing extra code

## Introduction

This project was build out of frustration with static site generators such as Jekyll or Hugo. I've used most of them, and while they are convenient, I felt locked-into my choice because the content was coupled with the design and layout of the pages. I also couldn't write content in any form I wanted, such as latex.

## QuickStart

```
cargo run -- serve --path test/content
```

## Supported Formats

- CommonMark
- Pandoc (any format)

## Supported Metadata

Each post comes with a `build.yaml` that contains metadata. The metadata is inspired by the frontmatter of popular blogging frameworks such as:

- https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/
- https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/

```yaml
# [required] Your post title
title: A post in markdown

# [required] date when the post was or will be published, in RFC 3339 format
date: "2020-04-10"

# A brief description of your post, often used as a preview
description: |
  A longer preview 

# if not given, a slug will be auto-generated by kebab-casing the title
slug: "a-post-in-markdown"

# Most downstream applications will generate a URL for your post based on the slug (e.g. /[date]/slug). Setting this fields means you want to explicitly set the url
url: 

# marks the post as a draf (non-published) post
